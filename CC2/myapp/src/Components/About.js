        <h1>About Our Beauty Products</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to our world of beauty! we believe that everyone deserves to feel
          beautiful inside and out.We are passionate about providing high-quality products. Our commitments focus on three key areas - the planet, the people, our products – with multiple initiatives and day-to-day actions to achieve our goals. Because we committed to do everything in our power to be exemplary.
          Delivering financial performance while being a committed corporate citizen is probably our greatest source of pride. This is what motivates us to always go the extra mile.

Jean .we have long been committed to making a positive contribution to society but the time has come to accelerate our efforts. We want to demonstrate that companies can be part of the solution to the challenges the world is facing and, to do so, we are allocating 150 million euros to address urgent social and environmental needs.

To address urgent social challenges, we have created L'Oréal Fund for Women, a 50 million euro charitable endowment fund to support on the ground organizations and local charities helping highly vulnerable women. The Fund was renewed in 2023 for three additional years, for an amount of 30 million euros.

On the environmental level, we have decided to dedicate 100 million euros to impact investing.
